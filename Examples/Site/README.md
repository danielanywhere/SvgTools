## Example Pages Site

Note that due to security restrictions when handling SVGs as external objects from an HTML host page, that page must be loaded from a webserver. On Windows, that can easily be accomplished within VSCode with Kestrel (.NET SDK extension) or IIS Express server extension.

Please run this folder from a local web server to view the page demonstrations.
