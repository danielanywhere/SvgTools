## Example Pages Site

Note that due to security restrictions when using JavaScript to control SVGs as external objects from an HTML host page, as in the case with GUIscape.svg, whose counter values are being incremented from the HTML host, that page must be loaded from a webserver. On Windows, that can easily be accomplished within VSCode with Kestrel (.NET SDK extension) or IIS Express server extension.

To see the counter run on the GUIscape.svg page, please run this folder from a local web server to view the page demonstrations.
